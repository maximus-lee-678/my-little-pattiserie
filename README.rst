🍰 My Little Pattiserie
========================
| A PHP-based website for a cafe that accepts pre-orders and in-store ordering.
| My Little Patisserie consists of 2 different interfaces - Customer Site and Admin Portal. 
| As the name suggests, the Customer Site is designed to allow customers to get to know about the cafe, 
| acts as an e-menu, and allows the customers to place their orders for in-store dining or pre-order takeouts.
|
| Originally named **ict1004-team02-2021**, this project was created to review the theories and principles covered in our Web System & Technologies module.
